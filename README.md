# Fibonacci-Sequence-Generator-in-Hexadecimal

Introduction
The Hexadecimal Fibonacci Generator is designed to generate Fibonacci numbers using the hexadecimal number system. This generator utilizes an optimized iterative algorithm that ensures optimal time and space complexity. By offering the Fibonacci sequence in the hexadecimal format, users gain a unique perspective on the sequence's numeric representation.

Hexadecimal Representation
Hexadecimal, often referred to as "hex," is a base-16 numbering system. In contrast to the decimal (base-10) system, the hexadecimal utilizes 16 distinct symbols: 0-9 and A-F, where A represents 10, B represents 11, and so forth. Hexadecimal is frequently used in computing due to its compact representation of binary data.
